Few studies have compared the effectiveness of hygienic cleaning under simulated use conditions. This study compares commonly used and novel cleaning methods for food contact and hand contact surfaces in kitchens. 
 
{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}:  
We report results from two surveys on Norwegian consumers' cleaning procedures. Laboratory models involving cutting boards, tap handles and mobile phones contaminated with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were used to compare the hygiene efficacy of commonly used cleaning methods together with new technologies (sprays, single-use wipes, and chlorine-based disinfectants). Commonly used cleaning methods produced a mean log10 reduction ({LR}) in contamination of 1·5-2·5. The efficacy could be improved by drying or including a disinfection step (mean {LR} 3·1-4·6). Cleaning of mobile phones was common and was improved by including humidity (1·5-1·9 mean {LR}). 
 
{CONCLUSIONS}:  
In many situations, traditional methods used by consumers may be sufficient to hygienically clean surfaces. However, in some situations, such as where there are infected or immune-compromised individuals, or where high risk foods are being handled, hygiene practices resulting in higher {LR} should be recommended. 
 
{SIGNIFICANCE} {AND} {IMPACT} {OF} {THE} {STUDY}:  
This study demonstrates that data from models simulating use conditions are required to estimate the effectiveness of detergent-based removal practices and how these can be enhanced by inactivation processes such as drying and disinfection to ensure that contamination from food-borne pathogens is reduced to acceptable levels to prevent infection transmission.},

	abstract = {An informed consumer can compensate for several potential food safety violations or contaminations that may occur earlier in the food production chain. However, a consumer can also destroy the work of others in the chain by poor food handling practices, e.g., by storing chilled ready-to-eat foods at abusive temperatures. To target risk-reducing strategies, consumer groups with high-risk behavior should be identified. The aim of this study was to identify demographic characteristics associated with high-risk food handling practices among Norwegian consumers. More than 2,000 randomly selected Norwegian consumers were surveyed, and the results were analyzed with a risk-based grading system, awarding demerit points for self-reported food safety violations. The violations were categorized into groups, and an ordinary multiple linear regression analysis was run on the summarized demerit score for each group and for the entire survey group as a whole. Young and elderly men were identified as the least informed consumer groups with the most unsafe practices regarding food safety. Single persons reported poorer practices than those in a relationship. People with higher education reported poorer practices than those with lower or no education, and those living in the capital of Norway (Oslo) reported following more unsafe food practices than people living elsewhere in Norway. Men reported poorer food safety practices than women in all categories with two exceptions: parboiling raw vegetables before consumption and knowledge of refrigerator temperature. These findings suggest that risk-reducing measures should target men, and a strategy is needed to change their behavior and attitudes.},

	title = {Food handling practices and knowledge of food safety among norwegian consumes},
	abstract = {Foodborne illness constitutes a significant burden both socially and economically on the society and their health systems and food safety is therefore becoming increasingly important. Billions are invested in food safety and much research is conducted on how to improve the safety of foods in all steps in the food production chain from production on the farm to manufacturing, distribution and retailing, but the last link in the food production chain – the consumer step - is still less understood. 
The food risk situation in Norway is not comparable with other European countries or the United States. The Norwegian population has so far been spared for problems with Salmonella spp., and there is reason to believe that Norwegian consumers thus have overall poorer kitchen hygiene and less knowledge of food safety. The aim with this thesis was therefore to increase our knowledge of Norwegian consumers’ food handling practices in the domestic environment and to investigate the importance of these practices with respect to the risk of acquiring foodborne illness. 
Collection of data on Norwegian consumers’ knowledge, attitudes and behavior regarding food safety were done with the aid of two surveys and a case study of consumer food handling practices and subsequent temperature exposure. Two laboratory experiments were conducted investigating growth and survival of foodborne pathogens simulating two common consumer food handling practices; Ready-To-Eat ({RTE}) foods taken out and in of the refrigerator, and cooking of hamburgers. A foods safety questionnaire based on {HACCP} methodology was developed and a risk-based grading system for food safety was adapted to the survey. This constituted a tool for grading various food handling practices from their inherent risk of causing foodborne illness. This system was also used to identify demographic characteristics of Norwegian consumers associated with critical food handling practices.},
